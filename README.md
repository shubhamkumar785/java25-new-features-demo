# Java 25 New Features Demo üöÄ

This repository contains examples of **Java 25 language enhancements** with simple code snippets and explanations.  
It helps beginners and developers quickly understand the latest updates in Java.

---

## ‚ú® Features Covered

1. **Instance Main Methods**  
   - Write `void main()` without `public static` or `String[] args`.  
   - JVM automatically creates an instance and runs it.

2. **Compact Source Files**  
   - No need to wrap everything inside a `class`.  
   - Great for quick testing and learning.

3. **Simplified I/O for Beginners**  
   - Use `IO.println()` and `IO.readln()` instead of `System.out` and `Scanner`.  
   - Makes Java coding as simple as Python for I/O.

4. **Automatic Imports**  
   - Common APIs from `java.base` are auto-imported.  
   - Cleaner code with less boilerplate.

5. **Flexible Constructors**  
   - Statements allowed before `super()` or `this()` calls.  
   - Enables validation/setup in constructors.

6. **Module Import Declarations**  
   - Use `import module java.sql;` style.  
   - Simplifies module usage and improves modularity.

7. **Scoped Values**  
   - Safer alternative to `ThreadLocal`.  
   - Share data across threads within a limited scope.
